1. Create HTML structure for the crossword grid:
    - Use div to represent each square in the grid.
    - Number each square for the starting point of each entry.

2. Style the grid using CSS:
    - Define styles for black and white squares.
    - Create JS event so black squares cannot be clicked.
    - Add CSS rules for numbering and highlighting active squares.

3. Populate the grid with words:
    - Use JavaScript to fill in the grid with words, aligning with the numbering.
    - Clue bank on bottom/side with corresponding numbers for "down" and "across."

4. User interaction:
    - Add event listeners to detect when a square is clicked.

5. Inputting answers:
    - Implement input fields for users to enter their answers.
    - Use function to validate user input against the correct answers.

6. Track progress:
    - Create a system to track completed words and overall puzzle completion.
    - Update the grid/clue bank to show progress.
